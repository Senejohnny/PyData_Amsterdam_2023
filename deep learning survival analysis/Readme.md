# Deep Learning Survival Analysis

This implementation of survival analysis for unstructured text data is inspired by the work 
DeepSurv: personalized treatment recommender system using a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network available in https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1. A tensorflow implementation of this model is made available by Sebastian PÃ¶lsterl in https://github.com/sebp/survival-cnn-estimator. The purpose of this small project is to extend deepSurv model to unstructured, i.e., text, data.
